Project Idea: Personal Expense Management System with Mobile App Integration
Overview:
ExpensoTrack is a comprehensive personal expense management system that allows users to track their expenses, categorize them, and view insightful statistics through a web dashboard and a mobile app. This integration ensures users can manage their finances seamlessly, whether at home or on the go.

Tech Stack:
Backend: FastAPI
Databases: PostgreSQL for relational data (user authentication, expense categories), MongoDB for non-relational data (expense records, transaction logs)
Frontend: Vue.js
Features:
User Authentication and Management:

Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
User data is stored in PostgreSQL for secure and structured access.
Expense Tracking:

Users can add, edit, and delete expense records.
Each expense includes details such as amount, date, category, and description.
Expense records are stored in MongoDB for flexible schema and fast querying.
Categories Management:

Users can create and manage expense categories (e.g., Food, Travel, Utilities).
Categories are stored in PostgreSQL.
Dashboard and Analytics:

Users can view a dashboard with various statistics about their expenses.
Display monthly spending summaries, category-wise breakdowns, and trends over time.
Statistics are calculated using data from MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
Budget Alerts and Notifications:

Users can set monthly budgets for different categories.
The system sends alerts when spending approaches or exceeds the set budget.
Alerts and notifications are managed through FastAPI.
Reports and Exporting:

Users can generate reports for specific periods.
Reports can be exported in various formats (PDF, CSV).
Responsive Design:

The frontend is built with Vue.js and designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Detailed Workflow:
User Authentication:

Users register and log in using FastAPI, with authentication data stored in PostgreSQL.
Adding Expenses:

Users input expense data through a Vue.js form.
The form sends data to FastAPI, which stores it in MongoDB.
Category Management:

Users manage categories through the Vue.js frontend.
Category data is sent to FastAPI and stored in PostgreSQL.
Dashboard Display:

The Vue.js frontend fetches expense data from FastAPI.
Data is aggregated and displayed using various charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js).
Budget Alerts:

Users set budget limits via the Vue.js frontend.
FastAPI checks expenses against these limits and sends notifications when limits are approached/exceeded.
Report Generation:

Users request reports through the frontend.
FastAPI generates the report using data from both PostgreSQL and MongoDB, then returns it to the frontend for download.
Summary:
This project integrates FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Vue.js to create a robust personal expense management system. Users can track their expenses, manage categories, view detailed analytics, and stay informed with budget alerts. The use of PostgreSQL and MongoDB allows for efficient data management and flexible querying, while Vue.js ensures a responsive and user-friendly interface.
By integrating a mobile app with the ExpensoTrack web platform, users gain the flexibility to manage their finances from anywhere. The mobile app, built with Flutter, ensures a consistent and high-quality user experience across both iOS and Android. The backend, powered by FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, supports seamless data synchronization and robust performance, making ExpensoTrack a powerful tool for personal expense management.
